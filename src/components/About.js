          passionate about building scalable applications and experiences that
          can help make a difference or simply brighten someones day.

          I’m a recent graduate of Flatiron School's Software Engineering
          Bootcamp. Previously, I worked as a marketing and community manager at
          a job platform start-up built for creatives of all different mediums
          and skills where I often collaborated with designers and developers.

          When I'm not coding, I shoot film photography, make way too many music
          playlists and hang out with my dog Appa. I’m currently based in New
          York, where I was born and raised.
